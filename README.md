# README-Generator
## Description

This challenge wanted us to generate a README.md file using our new skills we learned with node. For this challenge we were given some starter code to begin with. Using our index.js file I came up with a list of prompt questions to be answered in the terminal when we run it. We also have a generateMarkdown.js file were I came up with the outline of how I would like my README.md file to look like. Once we're ready to start we can open our terminal by right clicking on the index.js file. By typing in node index.js our prompt questions will appear one by one. Once all the questions are answer correctly it will generate a generateMarkdown.md page where all the information we typed in will appear. After that we can right click it and select open preview to view our new README.md file. 



##  renderLicenseBadge
For this challenge we needed to add the option for the user to select what license their application will be under. The three I choose were, MIT, APACHE, and Mozilla. To find the badges I used URL https://gist.github.com/lukas-h/2a5d00690736b4c3a7ba. renderLicenseBadge function with he URL's can be found in the generateMarkdown.js file. 



## Github 

On Github I was able to create a new repository where I was able to push all my work to. Before even starting the challenge I had to clone the new repository to the my computer first. I cloned it using my gitbash, from there on any code I worked on visual studio code I was able to save it and push it back to my repository. Once all my work was done I did a final push.
